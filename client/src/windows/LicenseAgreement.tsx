        <h3>3. Data processing and privacy</h3>
        <p>
            The Product is designed with <strong>privacy and security</strong> in mind. All data
            processing occurs <strong>exclusively on the client side</strong>, meaning that no
            confidential information (such as passwords, encryption keys, or file contents) is sent
            to or stored on the server.
        </p>
        <p>
            The server only exchanges <strong>service-related data</strong>, such as page requests
            and other necessary data for proper functioning of the website.{' '}
            <strong>No sensitive data</strong> such as encryption keys, passwords, or the contents
            of your files are stored or processed on our server.
        </p>

        <h3>4. File sharing and security</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>File sharing</strong>: You are free to share the encrypted files through
                email, messaging services, social media, or store them on both removable and
                non-removable media. Encrypted files can be safely shared without compromising their
                contents as long as the password remains secure.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Password security</strong>: You acknowledge and understand that in order to
                ensure the safety of encrypted files, the password used to encrypt the files should
                be <strong>kept secret</strong> and shared only through secure channels.{' '}
                <strong>Never share your password through insecure methods</strong> (e.g.,
                unencrypted messages or insecure platforms).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>File integrity</strong>: You are informed that{' '}
                <strong>modifying or changing the file</strong> after encryption, such as
                compressing (except for archiving) or altering its contents, can result in{' '}
                <strong>irreversible data loss</strong> and make it impossible to decrypt the file.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Use case restrictions</h3>

                <strong>not intended</strong> for encrypting documents containing{' '}
                <strong>government, industrial, commercial</strong>, or other types of sensitive or
                classified information.

                to handle encrypted information if necessary, and they can decrypt information,
                regardless of the encryption method used.

                held responsible for any potential data breaches or unauthorized access to files.
                The security of encrypted files relies directly on the{' '}
                <strong>security of the user&apos;s device</strong> (including protection from
                malware, unauthorized access, or other security vulnerabilities) and the{' '}
                <strong>password integrity</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No file decryption guarantee</strong>: The authors of the project do not
                guarantee that a file will be successfully decrypted if it has been modified,
                compressed (other than archived), damaged, or encrypted by a different application.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>File content</strong>: The authors are not responsible for the content of
                the files you encrypt or decrypt, nor for how they are used afterward. You are
                solely responsible for ensuring the legality and appropriateness of the files you
                process.
            </li>

            that you use appropriate security measures for your passwords and devices.

        <p>
            The Product is intended to be used in compliance with all applicable laws and
