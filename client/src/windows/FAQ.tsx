        <h2>Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h2>

        <h3>üí∞ How much does it cost?</h3>
        <p>
            It&apos;s <strong>100% free</strong>! There are no hidden fees, no subscriptions, and no
            payments required. Our goal is to make digital security accessible to everyone without
            any barriers.
        </p>

        <h3>üóùÔ∏è Where can I decrypt encrypted files?</h3>
        <p>
            You can <strong>only decrypt files here, in this web app</strong>. All encryption and
            decryption processes happen locally in your browser to ensure your data remains private.
            We&apos;re working on offline and mobile versions of the app for even more convenience,
            but now, this web app is the only place where decryption is supported.
        </p>

        <h3>üîì Can I decrypt files here that were encrypted in another app?</h3>
        <p>
            No. You can only decrypt files that were{' '}
            <strong>previously encrypted using {APPLICATION_NAME}</strong>. This is because it uses
            a custom file structure that is not compatible with other encryption formats. We do not
            intend to support third-party encryption formats, as our focus is on maintaining a
            simple, secure, and consistent experience within this application.
        </p>

        <h3>üì¶ What is the maximum file size?</h3>
        <p>
            The maximum file size you can encrypt or decrypt is{' '}
            <strong>{MAX_FILES_SIZE_MB}MB</strong>. This ensures that the encryption process is quick
            and efficient while maintaining security. If your file exceeds this size, you might need
            to compress or split it into smaller parts.
        </p>

        <h3>üìÅ What file types can I use?</h3>
        <p>
            You can use <strong>any file format</strong>, whether it&apos;s a document, image,
            audio, video, or any other type of file. However,{' '}
            <strong>folder uploads are currently not supported</strong>, but we are working on it.
        </p>

        <h3>üìÇ Can I upload multiple files or a whole folder?</h3>
        <p>
            At this time, we do not support uploading multiple files or entire folders for
            encryption. However, as a workaround, you can compress your files into a{' '}
            <strong>ZIP archive</strong> and then encrypt that archive. We&apos;re also working on
            adding native support for multiple file uploads and folders in a future release.
        </p>

        <h3>üö´ I can‚Äôt encrypt or decrypt a file. What should I do?</h3>
        <p>If you&apos;re having trouble encrypting or decrypting a file, first, ensure that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The file isn&apos;t corrupted or damaged.</li>
            <li>
                The password you entered is correct (make sure Caps Lock is off, there are no typos
                or extra spaces).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If the issue persists and you&apos;ve verified that the file and password are correct,
            please file a bug report on{' '}
            <Link href={GITHUB_URL} target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                our GitHub project page
            </Link>
            . When filing the report, be sure to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Mention the <strong>file extension</strong> of the encrypted file.
            </li>
            <li>
                Attach a <strong>screenshot</strong> of the error or issue.
            </li>
            <li>
                Upload the <strong>developer console output</strong> (Open Developer Tools (F12){' '}
                {'>'} Go to the Console tab).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You don&apos;t need to upload the encrypted file itself, but if you can provide another
            example file that reproduces the issue (without sensitive data), it would help us
            resolve the issue faster.
