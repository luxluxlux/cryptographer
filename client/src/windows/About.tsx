                {APPLICATION_NAME} is not backed by a corporation or a team - it&apos;s a project
                developed by a single enthusiast who believes that{' '}
                <strong>
                    digital security should be simple, private, and accessible to everyone
                </strong>
                . Despite that, I use the pronoun &quot;we&quot; to reflect a vision for the future
                - the belief that, over time, the project will grow into something greater,
                supported by a community of contributors, users, and like-minded people.
            </p>
            <p>
                We&apos;re looking for enthusiasts who want to contribute out of passion, curiosity,
                or the desire to build something meaningful. Whether you&apos;re a developer,
                designer, security researcher, or just someone who believes in the mission - your
                input is welcome.
